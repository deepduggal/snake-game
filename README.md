# snake-game
A snake that eats food. Made with pure JS (canvas). Responsive.

Not sure when I'll work on this.

Basic Features
- Arrow Keys to move or snake will automove
- Food spawns at a random location
- Eat the food
- Lose by
  - Crashing into side
  - Crashing into yourself
  - Going backwards (Currently doesn't move you backwards, but doesn't kill you).
- Responsive

Future Features:
- Touch Controls
- Local two player (WASD)
- Full screen, remove square game shape requirement

Issues
- Using timers. Should transition to something else. requestAnimationFrame?

# Snake: The Game
A snake that eats food. Made with pure JS (canvas). Responsive (done). Touch controls - swipe (done)

Not sure when I'll finish this.

Basic Features
- Arrow Keys to move or snake will automove (Done)
- Food spawns at a random location
- Eat the food and grow
- Lose by
  - Crashing into side (done)
  - Crashing into yourself
  - Going backwards (Currently doesn't move you backwards, but doesn't kill you).
- Responsive (Done)
- Touch Controls (Done)

Future Features:
- Local two player (WASD)
- More screen, remove square game shape requirement.

Issues
- Using timers. Should use something else. requestAnimationFrame?
- Need to make the game show a message and restart when the game ends. Maybe a menu.
